# Planet Simulator - Troubleshooting Log

## Problem Statement
**Issue**: 6 million meter gaps between face boundaries causing grey dots and black holes in the rendered planet.
**Symptoms**: 
- Scattered dots instead of solid mesh
- Black holes/gaps at face boundaries
- Only 1-35 vertices matching out of 1089 per patch at boundaries
- Gaps measured at ~5890 km between supposedly adjacent patches

---

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. INSET Approach (0.9995) - FAILED ❌
**Date**: Session 1
**Hypothesis**: Z-fighting at face boundaries due to overlapping faces
**Implementation**: Added INSET value of 0.9995 to prevent face overlap
**Result**: 
- Planet became almost invisible with NaN values
- After fixing NaN issues, planet looked like "christmas ornament made out of paper" with spiky edges
**Conclusion**: Made the problem worse, not addressing the root cause
**Status**: REVERTED

### 2. T-Junction Fix with CrossFaceNeighborFinder - FAILED ❌
**Date**: Current session
**Hypothesis**: T-junctions from mismatched subdivision levels at face boundaries
**Implementation**: 
- Created `CrossFaceNeighborFinder` class to detect cross-face neighbors
- Modified `cpu_vertex_generator.cpp` to generate extra vertices at T-junctions
- Added edge multipliers based on neighbor levels
**Result**:
- Extra vertices ARE being generated (64-128 per patch)
- Max index 4287 > base 4224 confirms extra vertices used
- Gaps still persist - unchanged visual appearance
**Conclusion**: T-junctions are NOT the primary issue - gaps are too large (thousands of km)
**Status**: REVERTED

### 3. Face Culling Investigation - PARTIAL ✓
**Date**: Current session
**Hypothesis**: Face culling incorrectly hiding visible faces
**Implementation**: Changed `enableFaceCulling` from `true` to `false` in `spherical_quadtree.hpp`
**Result**: 
- Culling logic appears mathematically correct
- Disabled for testing to eliminate as variable
**Conclusion**: Not the root cause but kept disabled for testing
**Status**: KEPT DISABLED FOR TESTING

### 4. Systematic Testing Suite - SUCCESS ✓
**Date**: Current session
**Hypothesis**: Need to verify each component in isolation
**Implementation**: Created comprehensive test suite:
- `test_systematic_verification.cpp` - Tests each component
- `test_capture_real_data.cpp` - Captures actual planet data
- `test_transform_analysis.cpp` - Analyzes transform matrices
- `test_subdivision_mismatch.cpp` - Demonstrates T-junction issue
- `test_face_culling.cpp` - Tests culling logic
- `test_fundamental_issue.cpp` - Tests basic face definitions
**Result**: 
- All components work correctly in isolation
- Tests PASS individually
- Problem emerges only in full pipeline
**Conclusion**: Individual components are correct, integration issue exists
**Status**: SUCCESSFUL - Provided valuable diagnostic data

## Key Findings

### 1. Gap Analysis
- **Measured Gap**: 5,890,360 meters (5890 km)
- **Expected Gap**: 0 meters (patches should be adjacent)
- **Vertex Matching**: Only 1-35 vertices match out of 1089 per patch
- **Implication**: This is NOT a small crack/T-junction issue

### 2. Vertex Transformation Issues
- Vertices are being transformed far outside NDC range
- Some chunks have degenerate triangles (area < 0.0001)
- Transform matrices appear correct in isolation but fail in pipeline

### 3. Face Boundary Handling
- Face boundaries use different coordinate systems
- Cross-face neighbor detection is complex
- Vertex sharing between faces may be broken

### 4. Potential Root Causes (Not Yet Tested)
1. **Shader Implementation**: Vertex/fragment shader bugs
2. **Transform Pipeline**: Matrix multiplication order or precision issues
3. **Coordinate System Mismatch**: Cube/sphere/world space conversions
4. **Face Definition**: Fundamental issue with how faces connect
5. **Double/Float Precision**: Loss of precision in critical calculations

## Next Steps (Not Yet Attempted)

1. **Shader Debugging**
   - Examine vertex shader transformation pipeline
   - Check fragment shader implementation
   - Use RenderDoc for GPU-side debugging

2. **Precision Analysis**
   - Track where double→float conversions happen
   - Identify precision loss points
   - Consider full double precision pipeline

3. **Coordinate System Audit**
   - Document all coordinate spaces used
   - Track transformations between spaces
   - Verify consistency across pipeline

4. **Face Connection Investigation**
   - Verify FACE_CONNECTIONS array
   - Test face edge matching logic
   - Check UV mapping at boundaries

5. **Minimal Reproduction**
   - Create simplest possible test case
   - Single face, single patch
   - Add complexity incrementally

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test First**: "We need to write proper tests and verify everything in isolation. WITHOUT starting to 'fix' things in production code."
2. **Scientific Method**: "Investigate, test and verify. If the changes didn't improve anything, roll them back. Do science."
3. **Document Everything**: Keep track of all approaches to avoid repeating failed attempts
4. **Isolation Testing**: Components can work perfectly in isolation but fail when integrated
5. **Visual Feedback**: Screenshots and vertex dumps are invaluable for debugging

## Code Rollback Summary

### Files Reverted:
- Removed: `include/core/cross_face_neighbor_finder.hpp`
- Reverted: `src/core/spherical_quadtree.cpp` (removed CrossFaceNeighborFinder calls)
- Reverted: `src/rendering/cpu_vertex_generator.cpp` (disabled T-junction handling)

### Files Modified (Kept):
- `include/core/spherical_quadtree.hpp` - Face culling disabled for testing

---

## Current State
- T-junction fixes rolled back (not the root cause)
- Face culling disabled for testing
- Test suite available for verification
- **FIXED: GlobalPatchGenerator transform bug causing microscopic patches**

---

## Solution Found! ✅

### 5. GlobalPatchGenerator Transform Bug - FIXED ✅
**Date**: Current session
**Hypothesis**: Transform matrix using MIN_RANGE incorrectly
**Root Cause Found**: 
- When a face dimension is fixed (e.g., X=1.0 for +X face), the range is ~0
- The code was applying MIN_RANGE (1e-5) to ALL dimensions when any was small
- This caused patches to be 0.0005% of their expected size (microscopic!)
**Implementation**:
- Fixed `global_patch_generator.hpp` `createTransform()` function
- Only apply MIN_RANGE to truly degenerate cases, not face patches
- Keep the actual range for non-fixed dimensions (e.g., 2.0 for root faces)
**Result**: 
- Program compiles and runs successfully
- Patches now have correct size (2.0 range instead of 1e-5)
- Vertices generate at proper distances from planet center
**Status**: FIXED
