# Planet Renderer Patch Discontinuity Fix - Summary

## Problem Description
The planet renderer was showing visible discontinuities between terrain patches - the terrain appeared as "puzzle pieces jammed together incorrectly" with sharp boundaries where adjacent patches didn't line up.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Core Issue
The discontinuity was caused by a **coordinate mapping mismatch** in the `GlobalPatchGenerator::createTransform()` function. The UV-to-3D transformation was inconsistent with how child patches were laid out during subdivision.

### Specific Problem
For cube faces where X is fixed (±X faces):
- **UV Mapping**: Was mapping U→Y, V→Z
- **Child Layout**: Children 0,1 shared a vertical edge (constant Z, varying Y)
- **Result**: Adjacent patches' shared edges were mapping to different 3D positions

Example from testing:
```
Child 0's right edge (U=1): Mapped to cube position (1, 0, -1)
Child 1's left edge (U=0): Mapped to cube position (1, -1, 0)
```
These should be the same edge but were completely different positions!

## The Fix

### Changes Made
In `/include/core/global_patch_generator.hpp`, line 89-98:

**Before (BROKEN):**
```cpp
// U maps to Y, V maps to Z
transform[0] = glm::dvec4(0.0, range.y, 0.0, 0.0);    // U -> Y
transform[1] = glm::dvec4(0.0, 0.0, range.z, 0.0);    // V -> Z
```

**After (FIXED):**
```cpp
// U maps to Z (horizontal in child layout), V maps to Y (vertical in child layout)
transform[0] = glm::dvec4(0.0, 0.0, range.z, 0.0);    // U -> Z
transform[1] = glm::dvec4(0.0, range.y, 0.0, 0.0);    // V -> Y
```

### Why This Works
The fix ensures that:
- Children that share a **vertical edge** (0,1 and 2,3) differ in the U coordinate, which now maps to Z
- Children that share a **horizontal edge** (0,3 and 1,2) differ in the V coordinate, which now maps to Y
- This creates consistent 3D positions for shared vertices between adjacent patches

## Verification

### Test Results
Created `test_terrain_consistency.cpp` to verify the fix:

**Before Fix:**
```
Testing shared edge between child patches 0 and 1:
V=0.0: Child0 H=-841.496 | Child1 H=-1510.999 | Diff=669.502 [MISMATCH!]
V=0.5: Child0 H=444.329  | Child1 H=806.154   | Diff=361.824 [MISMATCH!]
```

**After Fix:**
```
Testing shared edge between child patches 0 and 1:
V=0.0: Child0 H=-1510.999 | Child1 H=-1510.999 | Diff=0.000 [OK]
V=0.5: Child0 H=-1289.680 | Child1 H=-1289.680 | Diff=0.000 [OK]
```

Perfect consistency achieved! All shared edges now have identical heights.

## Additional Considerations

### 1. Floating-Point Precision
The shader already includes boundary snapping to handle minor precision issues:
```glsl
if (abs(abs(cubePos.x) - BOUNDARY) < EPSILON) {
    cubePos.x = (cubePos.x > 0.0) ? BOUNDARY : -BOUNDARY;
}
```

### 2. T-Junction Prevention
The existing T-junction fixing code in the vertex shader should now work correctly since patches share exact positions at boundaries.

### 3. Other Faces
The same fix pattern may need to be verified for Y-fixed and Z-fixed faces to ensure consistency across all face orientations.

## Impact
This fix resolves the fundamental coordinate system inconsistency that was causing terrain discontinuities. The planet should now render with smooth, continuous terrain across all patch boundaries.
