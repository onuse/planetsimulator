# Planet Renderer Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The +X and -X cube faces (Face 0 and Face 1) were completely missing from the rendered output despite being generated correctly.

## Root Cause
**Backface culling with incorrect triangle winding order**
- The GPU pipeline had `VK_CULL_MODE_BACK_BIT` enabled
- The X faces had their triangles wound in the opposite direction
- GPU was culling these faces thinking they were back-facing

## Evidence
- Render logs showed Face 0 and 1 generating 71 total patches
- These patches were processed and vertices generated
- But faces never appeared on screen (only tiny sliver visible)
- Disabling backface culling immediately fixed the issue

## The Fix
```cpp
// In src/rendering/vulkan_renderer_transvoxel.cpp line 590
rasterizer.cullMode = VK_CULL_MODE_NONE;  // Was VK_CULL_MODE_BACK_BIT
```

## Results
- **Before**: Only 4 of 6 cube faces visible (Green Y faces, Blue Z faces)
- **After**: All 6 cube faces now visible (Red X faces now appear!)

## Remaining Issues
1. **Holes in blue faces** - Green face showing through as dots
2. **Performance** - Disabling culling renders both sides of triangles (2x overdraw)

## Proper Solution (TODO)
Instead of disabling culling, fix the winding order for X faces:
1. Identify where X face triangles are generated
2. Reverse the winding order for these faces
3. Re-enable backface culling for performance

## Visual Proof
- Screenshot before fix: Missing pink/salmon colored faces
- Screenshot after fix: All faces visible including red/pink X faces
