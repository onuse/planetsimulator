# C++ Planet Evolution Simulator Roadmap

## Vision
A scientifically accurate **planet evolution simulator** that models 4.5 billion years of geological processes in real-time, starting from a molten protoplanet and evolving through plate tectonics, mountain formation, erosion, and climate change using hierarchical voxel rendering.

## Core Philosophy
**We don't generate terrain - we evolve it.**
- Start with a young, simple planet (molten/smooth)
- Simulate geological processes over billions of years
- Mountains, continents, and oceans EMERGE from physics
- Every planet has a unique evolutionary history

## Phase 1: Foundation âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Vulkan application with GLM
- [x] Basic octree data structure
- [x] Simple sphere planet
- [x] Material system (rock, water, magma, air)
- [x] Instance-based rendering

## Phase 2: Initial Planet State ðŸš§ CURRENT
*Create a geologically young planet as the starting point*

### 2.1 Simple Initial Conditions
- [ ] Uniform molten surface (all magma)
- [ ] Basic cooling â†’ thin crust formation
- [ ] Initial water condensation in low areas
- [ ] No mountains, no continents (realistic!)

### 2.2 Voronoi Tectonic Plates
- [ ] Generate ~12-15 Voronoi cells as proto-plates
- [ ] Assign plate properties (density, thickness)
- [ ] Initial random velocities (cm/year scale)
- [ ] Plate boundary detection

### 2.3 Material System Enhancement
- [ ] Material mixing (rock % + water % per voxel)
- [ ] Temperature per voxel
- [ ] Pressure/stress fields
- [ ] Age tracking (when did this rock form?)

## Phase 3: Core Evolution Engine ðŸ”¬ CRITICAL
*The heart of the simulator - geological processes*

### 3.1 Plate Tectonics System
- [ ] Plate movement (velocity fields)
- [ ] Convergent boundaries â†’ Mountain building
- [ ] Divergent boundaries â†’ Rift valleys & new crust
- [ ] Transform boundaries â†’ Fault lines
- [ ] Subduction â†’ Deep ocean trenches

### 3.2 Thermal Evolution
- [ ] Heat dissipation from core
- [ ] Mantle convection cells
- [ ] Crustal cooling and thickening
- [ ] Volcanic hotspots (mantle plumes)

### 3.3 Surface Processes
- [ ] Basic erosion (height-based)
- [ ] Sediment transport (downhill flow)
- [ ] Deposition in basins
- [ ] Sea level changes

### 3.4 Time Control

- [ ] Geological epoch markers
- [ ] History playback

## Phase 4: Rendering Pipeline for Evolution ðŸŽ¨
*Critical: Preserve geological features across LOD levels*

### 4.1 Feature-Aware LOD
- [ ] Detect feature types (mountain, coast, ocean)
- [ ] Preserve peaks at distance (don't flatten mountains)
- [ ] Maintain material character (mountains stay gray, oceans blue)
- [ ] Smooth transitions between LOD levels

### 4.2 Material Mixing Renderer
- [ ] Blend materials based on percentages
- [ ] Natural gradients at boundaries
- [ ] Beaches, shorelines, snow lines

- [ ] Research applicability

## Key Insights from Testing

1. **Material Mixing is Essential**: Binary materials create artifacts. Need gradients for realism.

2. **LOD Must Preserve Features**: A mountain shouldn't become ocean when zoomed out.

3. **Scale-Independent Algorithms**: Patterns must work from meters to millions of meters.

4. **Evolution > Generation**: Starting simple and evolving is more interesting than generating complex terrain.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Fix Material Rendering**: Implement material mixing for proper water/rock boundaries
2. **Create Voronoi Plates**: Simple tectonic plate initialization
3. **Basic Plate Movement**: Simple velocity field simulation
4. **Feature-Aware LOD**: Ensure mountains stay mountains at all scales

## Why This Approach is Superior
