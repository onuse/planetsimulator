# C++ Octree Planet Roadmap

## Vision
A scientifically accurate **planet evolution simulator** that models 4.5 billion years of geological processes in real-time, starting from a molten protoplanet and evolving through plate tectonics, mountain formation, erosion, and climate change using hierarchical voxel rendering.
