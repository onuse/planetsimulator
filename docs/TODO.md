# GPU-Based Planet Simulation Renderer - Integration Roadmap

## Vision
A fully GPU-resident planet simulation where voxel data lives on the GPU and all mesh generation happens through compute shaders, enabling real-time terrain modification and physics simulation.

## Current State (December 2024)
- ✅ **Quadtree LOD System**: Working with 24 base patches, global budget, backface culling
- ✅ **Basic Rendering**: ~60 FPS at reasonable view distances
- ✅ **GPU Octree**: Successfully uploaded (32 nodes, 256 voxels)
- ✅ **Compute Pipeline**: Created and dispatching
- ✅ **Vertex Generation**: Compute shader generates correct format
- 🚧 **Index Generation**: Mismatch between GPU vertices and CPU indices
- ❌ **Voxel Sampling**: Still using debug sine waves instead of octree data
- ❌ **Dynamic Terrain**: Not possible until voxel sampling works

## Architecture Overview

### Current (Broken) Architecture
```
CPU Octree → [Unused]
     ↓
CPU Noise → CPU Mesh Generation → GPU Rendering
                  (5ms/patch)
```

### Target Architecture
```
GPU Voxel Octree (Persistent)
        ↓
GPU Compute Shaders → GPU Vertex Buffers → GPU Rendering
   (Parallel)              (Direct)          (Immediate)
```

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current Focus)
### Goal: Complete GPU mesh generation pipeline

1. **GPU Octree Upload** ✅ COMPLETE
   - ✅ GPUOctree class works
   - ✅ Octree is uploaded at startup (32 nodes, 256 voxels)
   - ✅ Confirmed uploading with debug output

2. **Compute Pipeline Setup** ✅ COMPLETE
   - ✅ Created compute shader (mesh_generator.comp)

   - ✅ Push constants pass patch transform and camera position
   - ✅ Compute shader dispatches successfully

3. **Vertex Generation** ✅ COMPLETE

   - [ ] Interpolate between voxels for smooth terrain

**Success Metrics**: 
- ✅ Compute shader runs successfully
- ✅ Vertex format matches CPU
- ❌ Vertices visible on screen (blocked by index mismatch)

## Technical Debt to Address

### Critical Blockers (Preventing GPU Path)
1. **Index Generation Mismatch**
   - GPU and CPU generate different vertex counts
   - Indices are tied to CPU vertex order
   - Must generate indices on GPU to match

2. **Single vs Multi-Patch Generation**
   - Currently reusing first patch's vertices for all patches
   - Need per-patch vertex generation
   - Decision: One large buffer vs per-patch buffers?

### Known Issues
1. **Patch Budget Persistence** (#107)
   - Budget stuck at limit after zooming out
   - Need to trigger full recalculation on altitude change

2. **Memory Management**
   - Proper GPU memory allocation strategy
   - Buffer pooling for patches
   - Streaming for massive planets

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Unified Coordinate System**
   - Resolve cube-to-sphere mapping inconsistencies
   - Implement proper face boundary handling
   - Share vertices at edges

2. **Test Coverage**
   - GPU compute shader tests
   - Voxel modification tests
   - Performance regression tests

## Implementation Strategy

### Principles
1. **Incremental Migration**: Keep both systems working during transition
2. **Test Everything**: Each phase must pass all existing tests
3. **Profile First**: Don't optimize without measurements
4. **Simple First**: Get it working, then optimize

### Development Flow
1. Implement minimal working version
2. Verify correctness with tests
3. Profile and identify bottlenecks
4. Optimize only what matters
5. Document for future developers

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **GPU Memory Limits**: Implement streaming early
- **Compute Shader Debugging**: Build visualization tools first
- **Platform Compatibility**: Test on min-spec GPU regularly

### Schedule Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stay focused on core path
- **Premature Optimization**: Profile before optimizing
- **Architecture Lock-in**: Keep interfaces flexible

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] All patches generated on GPU
- [ ] Performance >= current system
- [ ] Tests pass without modification

### Project Complete When:
- [ ] Fully dynamic planet with real-time modification
- [ ] 60 FPS with 1000+ patches
- [ ] Memory usage < 4GB for Earth-scale planet
- [ ] Clean, maintainable codebase

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Fix Index Generation** (CRITICAL)
   - Add index buffer binding to compute shader
   - Generate matching indices for GPU vertices
   - Test with single patch first

2. **Verify Single Patch Rendering**
   - Ensure GPU-generated patch is visible
   - Compare visual output with CPU version
   - Measure performance improvement

3. **Extend to Multiple Patches**
   - Generate vertices for all visible patches
   - Handle different patch transforms
   - Optimize dispatch strategy

4. **Sample Real Voxel Data**
   - Replace sine wave test pattern
   - Implement octree traversal
   - Generate terrain from actual voxels

5. **Delete CPU Path**
   - Remove CPUVertexGenerator
   - Remove procedural noise
   - Clean break, no fallback

## Key Insights from Implementation
- **Coordinate Space**: Vertices must be world space → camera-relative → scaled by 1/1,000,000
- **Vertex Format**: Must exactly match PatchVertex structure
- **Index Problem**: This is the critical blocker - can't use CPU indices with GPU vertices
- **Octree Ready**: The octree is successfully on GPU, just needs to be sampled
