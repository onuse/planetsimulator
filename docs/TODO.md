# GPU-Based Planet Simulation Renderer - Integration Roadmap

## Vision
A fully GPU-resident planet simulation where voxel data lives on the GPU and all mesh generation happens through compute shaders, enabling real-time terrain modification and physics simulation.

## Current State (December 2024)
- ✅ **Quadtree LOD System**: Working with 24 base patches, global budget, backface culling
- ✅ **Basic Rendering**: ~60 FPS at reasonable view distances
- ❌ **Voxel Integration**: Octree exists but disconnected from rendering
- ❌ **Mesh Generation**: CPU-based using procedural noise (5ms per patch)
- ❌ **Dynamic Terrain**: Not possible - terrain is procedural, not data-driven

## Architecture Overview

### Current (Broken) Architecture
```
CPU Octree → [Unused]
     ↓
CPU Noise → CPU Mesh Generation → GPU Rendering
                  (5ms/patch)
```

### Target Architecture
```
GPU Voxel Octree (Persistent)
        ↓
GPU Compute Shaders → GPU Vertex Buffers → GPU Rendering
   (Parallel)              (Direct)          (Immediate)
```

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current Focus)
### Goal: Establish GPU-resident voxel storage

1. **GPU Octree Upload** ✅ (Infrastructure exists)
   - Verify GPUOctree class works
   - Ensure octree is uploaded at startup
   - Add debug visualization to confirm data is on GPU

2. **Voxel Sampling Infrastructure**
   - [ ] Create compute shader for octree traversal
   - [ ] Test shader can read voxel data correctly
   - [ ] Add debug output to verify sampling accuracy

3. **Basic GPU Mesh Generation**
   - [ ] Create compute shader that takes patch params
   - [ ] Sample octree at grid points
   - [ ] Output vertex buffer directly on GPU
   - [ ] Start with simple height-only (no materials yet)

**Success Metrics**: 
- Mesh generation < 1ms per patch
- Identical visual output to current system

## Phase 2: Full Integration
### Goal: Replace CPU pipeline entirely

1. **Complete Vertex Generation**
   - [ ] Add normal calculation in compute shader
   - [ ] Add material ID sampling from voxels
   - [ ] Implement LOD morphing on GPU

2. **Remove CPU Dependencies**
   - [ ] Delete CPUVertexGenerator
   - [ ] Remove procedural noise functions
   - [ ] Ensure all patches use GPU generation

3. **Optimization**
   - [ ] Implement vertex caching on GPU
   - [ ] Add frustum culling in compute shader
   - [ ] Optimize octree traversal with mipmapping

**Success Metrics**:
- Support 1000+ patches at 60 FPS
- Zero CPU mesh generation

## Phase 3: Dynamic Planet
### Goal: Enable real-time terrain modification

1. **Voxel Modification Pipeline**
   - [ ] Compute shader for voxel updates
   - [ ] Crater/explosion effects
   - [ ] Terrain raising/lowering tools

2. **Incremental Updates**
   - [ ] Mark dirty regions in octree
   - [ ] Regenerate only affected patches
   - [ ] Temporal spreading of updates

3. **Physics Integration**
   - [ ] Erosion compute shader
   - [ ] Water flow simulation
   - [ ] Volcanic activity

**Success Metrics**:
- Modify terrain without frame drops
- Support 100+ modifications per second

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
### Goal: Full planet simulation

1. **Multi-resolution Octree**
   - [ ] Adaptive octree refinement
   - [ ] Stream in/out based on view
   - [ ] Compress distant voxels

2. **Atmospheric Rendering**
   - [ ] Volumetric atmosphere
   - [ ] Cloud layer generation
   - [ ] Weather patterns

3. **Ecosystem Simulation**
   - [ ] Vegetation growth
   - [ ] City development
   - [ ] Resource distribution

## Technical Debt to Address

### Immediate Issues
1. **Patch Budget Persistence** (#107)
   - Budget stuck at limit after zooming out
   - Need to trigger full recalculation on altitude change

2. **Memory Management**
   - Proper GPU memory allocation strategy
   - Buffer pooling for patches
   - Streaming for massive planets

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Unified Coordinate System**
   - Resolve cube-to-sphere mapping inconsistencies
   - Implement proper face boundary handling
   - Share vertices at edges

2. **Test Coverage**
   - GPU compute shader tests
   - Voxel modification tests
   - Performance regression tests

## Implementation Strategy

### Principles
1. **Incremental Migration**: Keep both systems working during transition
2. **Test Everything**: Each phase must pass all existing tests
3. **Profile First**: Don't optimize without measurements
4. **Simple First**: Get it working, then optimize

### Development Flow
1. Implement minimal working version
2. Verify correctness with tests
3. Profile and identify bottlenecks
4. Optimize only what matters
5. Document for future developers

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **GPU Memory Limits**: Implement streaming early
- **Compute Shader Debugging**: Build visualization tools first
- **Platform Compatibility**: Test on min-spec GPU regularly

### Schedule Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stay focused on core path
- **Premature Optimization**: Profile before optimizing
- **Architecture Lock-in**: Keep interfaces flexible

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] All patches generated on GPU
- [ ] Performance >= current system
- [ ] Tests pass without modification

### Project Complete When:
- [ ] Fully dynamic planet with real-time modification
- [ ] 60 FPS with 1000+ patches
- [ ] Memory usage < 4GB for Earth-scale planet
- [ ] Clean, maintainable codebase

## Next Steps
1. Verify GPUOctree upload works
2. Create basic compute shader for mesh generation
3. Replace one patch with GPU generation as proof of concept
4. Gradually migrate all patches to GPU generation
5. Delete CPU generation code
