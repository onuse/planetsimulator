# Planet Renderer Architecture Overhaul

## Guiding Philosophy

**"Be complex about CORRECTNESS, be simple about IMPLEMENTATION"**

- The architecture must be mathematically correct and future-proof
- The implementation should be as simple as possible while maintaining correctness
- Optimize only what profiling shows needs optimization
- Every piece of code should be understandable by a junior developer in 5 minutes

## Problem Statement

The current planet renderer has a fundamental architectural flaw: patches at cube face boundaries cannot share edges because their parameterizations create perpendicular lines in 3D space. This results in:

- **6 million meter gaps** between patches that should connect
- Visible seams and discontinuities in the rendered planet
- Tests that pass but don't reflect the actual geometry
- No clear path to fix the issue with the current architecture

## Root Cause Analysis

### Current (Broken) Architecture
```
Face-Centric → Each face generates patches independently
↓
Patches "hope" to align at boundaries through epsilon snapping
↓
Reality: Edges are perpendicular, only corners align
```

### Why It Fails
1. **No Single Source of Truth**: Each patch generates its own vertices
2. **Incompatible Parameterizations**: Face boundaries have different UV→3D mappings
3. **No Vertex Sharing**: Even if positions match, vertices aren't shared
4. **Epsilon Hacks**: Trying to fix fundamental design issues with floating-point tricks

## Proposed Solution: Unified Planetary Mesh System

### Core Principles (Architectural Invariants)
These MUST be correct from day 1:
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Every vertex position is computed exactly once
2. **Hierarchical Ownership**: Clear rules about vertex/edge/face ownership
3. **Continuous Manifold**: Planet is ONE continuous surface, not 6 separate faces
4. **Resolution Independence**: Architecture works at any LOD level

### Implementation Principles
Start simple, evolve based on profiling:
1. **Simplest Correct Implementation**: std::map before fancy data structures
2. **Clear Interfaces**: Allow implementation evolution without architectural changes
3. **Measure Then Optimize**: Profile before adding complexity
4. **Momentum Preservation**: Keep code understandable and maintainable

### New Architecture Layers

```
Level 1: Mathematical Foundation (PlanetGeometry)
    ↓
Level 2: Vertex Generation Layer (VertexGenerator)
    ↓
Level 3: Patch System (References, not ownership)
    ↓
Level 4: Continuous LOD System
    ↓
Level 5: Rendering Layer
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Proof of Concept [NEW]
**Goal**: Validate approach with minimal complexity
**Timeline**: 3 days

#### Tasks
- [ ] Create simple 2-face test case showing the problem
- [ ] Implement basic vertex sharing for just these 2 faces
- [ ] Measure performance vs current approach
- [ ] Validate that gaps are eliminated
- [ ] Go/No-go decision based on results

#### Success Criteria
- Gaps eliminated between test faces
- Performance within 20% of current
- Code remains simple and understandable

### Phase 1: Vertex Identity System (Simplified)
**Goal**: Establish a global vertex identification system
**Timeline**: 1 week

#### Initial Implementation (SIMPLE)
```cpp
// Start with this:
struct VertexID {
    uint64_t id;  // Just a hash of (face, u, v)
};

std::unordered_map<VertexID, glm::vec3> globalVertexCache;
```

#### Tasks
- [ ] Create simple `VertexID` as hash of position
- [ ] Implement canonical ID resolution for shared vertices
- [ ] Write tests proving vertices are shared correctly
- [ ] NO premature optimization - just correctness

#### Key Files to Create
- `include/core/vertex_id_system.hpp` (< 100 lines)
- `src/core/vertex_id_system.cpp` (< 200 lines)
- `tests/test_vertex_identity.cpp`

#### Tests
```cpp
TEST: Vertices at corners have consistent canonical IDs across all 3 faces
TEST: Edge vertices have consistent canonical IDs across 2 faces
TEST: ID encoding/decoding is reversible
TEST: Canonical ID resolution is deterministic
```

### Phase 2: Centralized Vertex Generation (Start Simple)
**Goal**: Single system that generates and caches all vertices
**Timeline**: 1 week

#### Initial Implementation
```cpp
class VertexGenerator {
    std::unordered_map<VertexID, glm::vec3> cache;  // Simple!
    
    glm::vec3 getVertex(VertexID id) {
        // Just 5 lines but CORRECT
        auto canonical = makeCanonical(id);
        if (cache.count(canonical)) return cache[canonical];
        return cache[canonical] = generateVertex(canonical);
    }
};
```

#### Tasks

```

## Test-Driven Development Strategy

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Each component in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
3. **Visual Tests**: Render output comparison
4. **Performance Tests**: Frame rate and memory
5. **Stress Tests**: Edge cases and limits

## Complexity Management Strategy

### Must Have From Day 1 (Core Correctness)
```cpp
// These are architectural invariants
- Vertex identity and canonical IDs
- Edge ownership rules  
- Coordinate system continuity
- Face boundary vertex sharing
```

### Design For But Implement Simply
```cpp
// Use interfaces to allow evolution
class IVertexCache {
    virtual vec3 get(VertexID) = 0;
};

class SimpleCache : public IVertexCache {
    std::unordered_map<VertexID, vec3> data;  // Start here
};

class OptimizedCache : public IVertexCache {
    // Implement later IF profiling shows need
    SpatialHash spatial;
    LRUCache lru;
    CompressedStorage compressed;
};
```

### Defer Until Proven Necessary
- Thread safety (start single-threaded)
- Memory compression (measure first)
- GPU compute generation (CPU might be fine)
- Predictive loading (simple might work)
- Custom allocators (standard might suffice)
- Lock-free structures (locks might be OK)

### The Momentum Test
Before adding complexity ask:
1. "Would a junior dev understand this in 5 minutes?"
2. "Is this solving a measured problem or hypothetical one?"
3. "Can this be added later without architectural change?"

If answer to any is "no", reconsider.

## Migration Strategy

### Incremental Approach
1. Build new system alongside old
2. Add feature flags to switch between systems
3. Migrate one face at a time
4. Validate each step with tests
5. Remove old system once fully migrated

### Rollback Plan
- Keep old system intact until new system is proven
- Use feature flags for A/B testing
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Zero gaps at face boundaries (< 1mm at closest zoom)
- [ ] No T-junctions at any LOD level
- [ ] Continuous normals across boundaries
- [ ] Deterministic vertex generation

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] 60+ FPS at 1080p on target hardware
- [ ] < 2GB memory usage for Earth-scale planet
- [ ] < 100ms LOD update time
- [ ] Linear scaling with planet detail

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] 100% test coverage for vertex identity system
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] No visual artifacts in standard scenarios
- [ ] Clean, maintainable architecture

## Open Questions

1. **Vertex Precision**: Should we use double precision throughout or mixed precision?
2. **Caching Strategy**: LRU cache, spatial cache, or hybrid?
3. **GPU Architecture**: Mesh shaders, compute shaders, or traditional pipeline?
4. **Coordinate System**: Keep cube mapping or switch to HEALPix/other?
5. **Memory Management**: Pool allocators, custom allocators, or standard?

## Timeline Estimate (Revised)

### Fast Path (Minimal Correct Implementation)
- **Phase 0**: 3 days (Proof of Concept)
- **Phase 1**: 1 week (Simple Vertex ID System)
- **Phase 2**: 1 week (Simple Vertex Generator)
- **Phase 3**: 2 weeks (Patch Refactor with basic implementation)
- **Phase 4**: 1 week (Basic LOD fixes)
- **Phase 5**: 3 days (Integration and validation)

**Total Fast Path**: ~4.5 weeks to correct, working system

### Optimization Phase (As Needed)
- **Month 2**: Profile and optimize based on actual bottlenecks
- **Month 3**: Add advanced features if required

This approach gets us to a correct system quickly, maintaining momentum while leaving room for optimization based on real needs rather than speculation.

## Notes

This is a major architectural change but necessary for a robust, scalable planet renderer. The current system's fundamental flaws cannot be fixed with incremental changes. This overhaul will provide:

1. **Correctness**: Mathematically sound approach
2. **Scalability**: Works from planets to pebbles
3. **Performance**: Better vertex reuse and caching
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features

The investment is worthwhile for a production-quality planet renderer.
