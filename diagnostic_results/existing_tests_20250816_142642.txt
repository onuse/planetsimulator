=== OCTREE MATERIAL PIPELINE TEST ===

TEST 1: Voxel Material Generation
---------------------------------
Surface node at distance 6.3e+06m
  Voxel 0: dist=6.2504e+06 -> Rock
  Voxel 1: dist=6.35039e+06 -> Rock
  Voxel 2: dist=6.2504e+06 -> Rock
  Voxel 3: dist=6.35039e+06 -> Rock
  Voxel 4: dist=6.2504e+06 -> Rock
  Voxel 5: dist=6.35039e+06 -> Rock
  Voxel 6: dist=6.2504e+06 -> Rock
  Voxel 7: dist=6.35039e+06 -> Rock

TEST 2: Material Counting
-------------------------
Scenario 1: Mixed surface (3 Rock, 4 Water, 1 Air)
  Counts: Air=1, Rock=3, Water=4, Magma=0
  Dominant: Water (expected: Water)

Scenario 2: All air
  Counts: Air=8, Rock=0, Water=0, Magma=0
  Dominant: Air (expected: Air)

Scenario 3: Tie (4 Rock, 4 Water)
  Counts: Air=0, Rock=4, Water=4, Magma=0
  Dominant: Rock

TEST 3: GPU Encoding
--------------------
Material Air: encoded=0x1 -> decoded mat=0, isLeaf=1
Material Rock: encoded=0x101 -> decoded mat=1, isLeaf=1
Material Water: encoded=0x201 -> decoded mat=2, isLeaf=1
Material Magma: encoded=0x301 -> decoded mat=3, isLeaf=1

TEST 4: Failure Scenarios
-------------------------
1. BLACK PLANET CAUSES:
   a) All nodes have Air material (0)
   b) Shader exits early without finding leaves
   c) Incorrect node traversal (wrong child indices)
   d) Materials not properly encoded in flags

2. DEBUGGING STRATEGY:
   a) Add debug output in GPU upload to verify materials
   b) Check first few leaf nodes for non-Air materials
   c) Verify shader receives correct data
   d) Test with hardcoded materials to isolate issue

3. LIKELY ISSUE:
   The voxels array might be uninitialized or all Air.
   The material counting might return 0 for all materials.
   The shader might not be finding the correct leaves.

=== RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS ===
1. Add console output in gpu_octree.cpp after line 190:
   std::cout << "Voxel materials: ";
   for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
       std::cout << (int)voxels[i].material << " ";
   }
   std::cout << "-> dominant: " << (int)dominantMaterial << std::endl;

2. Check if voxels are being initialized in octree.cpp
3. Verify the shader is receiving non-zero materials
4. Test with hardcoded non-Air material to isolate the issue
