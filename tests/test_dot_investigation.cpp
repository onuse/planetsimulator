    std::cout << "1. Dots appear in a regular grid pattern\n";
    std::cout << "2. Dots are colored differently than their surrounding face\n";
    std::cout << "3. Dots persist despite:\n";
    std::cout << "   - Fixing winding order (X-faces now render)\n";
    std::cout << "   - Adding faceId to vertex cache key\n";
    std::cout << "   - Increasing face boundary inset (0.9999 -> 0.9995)\n";
    std::cout << "4. Pattern suggests vertices, not random pixels\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "HYPOTHESIS TESTING:\n";
    std::cout << "===================\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "HYPOTHESIS 1: Inset didn't actually change\n";
    std::cout << "-------------------------------------------\n";
    std::cout << "Test: Check if 0.9995 is actually being used\n";
    std::cout << "Expected: Patches should generate from -0.9995 to 0.9995\n";
    std::cout << "Actual: Need to verify in patch generation\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "HYPOTHESIS 2: Dots are from LOD transitions\n";
    std::cout << "--------------------------------------------\n";
    std::cout << "Different LOD levels meeting might create artifacts\n";
    std::cout << "Test: Check if dots appear at patch boundaries\n";
    std::cout << "Pattern analysis: Are dots at regular 1/16, 1/32 intervals?\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "HYPOTHESIS 3: Vertex generation precision issue\n";

    std::cout << "CRITICAL QUESTIONS:\n";
    std::cout << "===================\n";
    std::cout << "1. Are the dots at EXACT grid positions (e.g., every 64th vertex)?\n";
    std::cout << "2. Do dots appear ONLY at boundaries or also in face interiors?\n";
    std::cout << "3. Are dots from the PREVIOUS face or NEXT face in render order?\n";
    std::cout << "4. Do dots move when camera moves (suggesting vertex issue)?\n";
    std::cout << "5. Are there exactly 65x65 vertices per patch (gridResolution)?\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "MEASUREMENTS NEEDED:\n";
    std::cout << "====================\n";
    std::cout << "1. Count exact number of dots visible\n";
    std::cout << "2. Measure spacing between dots (in vertices)\n";
    std::cout << "3. Identify which face's color each dot shows\n";
    std::cout << "4. Check if pattern is same on all faces\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "TEST PLAN:\n";
    std::cout << "==========\n";
    std::cout << "1. Add logging to show actual patch bounds being generated\n";
    std::cout << "2. Log vertex positions at x=0.9995, y=0.9995, etc.\n";
    std::cout << "3. Count vertices that have faceId != expected face\n";
    std::cout << "4. Temporarily disable vertex caching entirely\n";
    std::cout << "5. Render only one face at a time\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "PATTERN ANALYSIS:\n";
